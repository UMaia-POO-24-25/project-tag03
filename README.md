## Short Theme Description
"Bombing Entities.Snake" is an engaging challenge where the player takes control of a hungry snake navigating through a bomb-filled scenario. The goal is to guide it to the food scattered across the field, making it grow with each meal, while avoiding collisions with explosive bombs and its own ever-expanding body. The ultimate objective is to achieve the highest score possible by surviving as long as possible.

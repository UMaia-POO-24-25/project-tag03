# Analysis Report on the "Snake Game"

## Introduction

This chapter provides a detailed analysis of the classes used in the "Snake Game" project, implemented in Java. The goal is to highlight the function of each class, their main responsibilities, the adopted solutions.

## Difference Between `Entities` and `Logic`


- **Entities**: Contains classes that represent the **objects in the game**. These classes generally model the visual and interactive elements of the game, such as the snake (**Snake**), food (**Food**), and bombs (**Bomb**). They include attributes and behaviors directly related to the entities on the map.

- **Logic**: Groups the classes that handle the **game's mechanics and logic**. These classes control how the entities interact, how the game updates and displays itself, and the rules that govern the game's functionality. Examples include managing the map (**Map**), the main game loop (**Game**), and position handling (**Position**).
  
---

### 1. **Entities.Bomb**
- **Inheritance:** Extends the `Food` class.
- **Responsibility:** Represents bombs on the map, which act as traps for the snake.
- **Methods:**
  - `setPosition(Logic.Position newPosition)`: Changes the bomb's position on the map.

---

### 2. **Entities.Food**
- **Inheritance:** Extends the abstract class `Arena`.
- **Responsibility:** Represents the food the snake must consume to grow.
- **Properties:**
  - `Position position`: Position of the food on the map.
  - `String color`: Color of the food.
- **Methods:**
  - `show(TextGraphics graphics, int width, int height)`: Renders the food on the screen.
  - `getPosition()`: Returns the current position of the food.

---

### 3. **Entities.Snake**
- **Inheritance:** Extends the abstract class `Arena`.
- **Responsibility:** Controls the snake's logic, including movement, growth, and collision detection.
- **Properties:**
  - `int xspeed` and `int yspeed`: Snake's speed in each direction.
  - `ArrayList<Position> tail`: List representing the snake's tail.
  - `int total`: Total length of the tail.
- **Methods:**
  - `update()`: Updates the snake's position and size.
  - `show(TextGraphics graphics, int width, int height)`: Renders the snake on the screen.
  - `death()`: Checks if the snake collided with itself.
  - `dir(int x, int y)`: Changes the snake's direction.

---

### 4. **Logic.Arena**
- **Abstract:** Defines the basic structure for classes representing entities on the map.
- **Properties:**
  - `Position position`: Position of the entity.
- **Methods:**
  - `abstract void show(TextGraphics graphics, int width, int height)`: Abstract method to render entities on the screen.

---

### 5. **Logic.Game**
- **Responsibility:** Controls the main game loop, including state updates and interface rendering.
- **Properties:**
  - `Screen screen`: Manages the graphical interface using the **Lanterna** library.
  - `Map map`: Represents the game map.
- **Methods:**
  - `run()`: Executes the main game loop.
  - `show()`: Updates the screen with the game entities.
  - `gameover()`: Displays the "Game Over" screen and ends the game.
  - `processKey(KeyStroke key)`: Processes user input via the keyboard.

---

### 6. **Logic.Map**
- **Responsibility:** Manages interactions between game entities and defines game logic rules.
- **Properties:**
  - `Snake s`: Instance of the snake.
  - `Food f`: Instance of the food.
  - `Bomb b`: Instance of the bomb.
  - `boolean gameOver`: Indicates if the game has ended.
  - `int score`: Player's score.
- **Methods:**
  - `show(TextGraphics graphics, int offsetX, int offsetY)`: Renders the map and its entities.
  - `moveSnakeUp/Down/Left/Right()`: Controls the snake's movement.
  - `updateSnake()`: Updates the snake's position and checks for collisions.
  - `createFood()` and `createBomb()`: Creates new instances of food and bombs.
  - `updateBomb()`: Moves the bomb to a new position.
  - `checkDeath()`: Checks game-over conditions.

---

### 7. **Logic.Position**
- **Responsibility:** Represents coordinates on the map.
- **Properties:**
  - `int x` and `int y`: Coordinates of the position.
- **Methods:**
  - Getters and setters for `x` and `y`.
  - `equals(Object o)`: Overrides to compare two positions.
